Search through only keyframes as a "main" method and use all frames as a fallback

    Is this worth it?

When removing segments, we could remove any leftover video that is just black.

Preserve subtitles

Maybe use Decimal instead of floats for more accurate output?
    ffmpeg definitely uses floats internally though.

    The bottleneck is still processing

    The ffmpeg trim filter takes frame counts too though :eyes:
    https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#trim
        atrim takes samples, and I'm not sure there's a way to figure that out cleanly.
        I'll need to look into it. Is it even worth it?

Detecting credits is difficult. 
    The current method is not good, we may need some sort of image-hashing or something like that. 
        The problem is that credits are mostly black and there may be other mostly black frames
        in your media that aren't credits, but the difference between the two frames is
        small because 99% of the frames is black.
