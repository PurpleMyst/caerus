When cutting up segments, remove any total-black ones

Preserve subtitles

Maybe use Decimal instead of floats for more accurate output?
ffmpeg definitely uses floats internally though.
The bottleneck is still processing

Detecting credits is difficult. The current method is not good, we may need some sort of
image-hashing or something like that. 
The problem is that credits are mostly black and there may be other mostly black frames
in your media that aren't credits, but the difference between the two frames is small
because 99% of the frames is black.
